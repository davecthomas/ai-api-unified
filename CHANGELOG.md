# Changelog

Notable changes per release, so consumers can gate on the package version.
Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); the authoritative
version lives in `pyproject.toml` (see the README release section).

## 2.14.0

Engine-agnostic completions features for workflow-service call shapes, fully
implemented on the native `claude` engine and capability-gated elsewhere.
Feature support is declared on `client.capabilities`
(`supports_tool_use`, `supports_structured_output`, `supports_async`);
unsupported calls raise `AiProviderCapabilityUnsupportedError`.

- `send_structured_output` (and `asend_structured_output`): single-shot
  structured extraction with `system_prompt`, multi-turn `messages`, a raw
  JSON Schema `response_schema` alternative to pydantic `response_model`,
  `provider_options`, `request_timeout_seconds`, and `max_response_tokens` up
  to the context limit (the `claude` engine streams and accumulates large
  budgets internally). Results carry parsed `data`, token `usage`, and a
  normalized `finish_reason` (`complete | length | tool_use | refusal`) so
  callers distinguish truncation from refusal in code.
- `send_prompt` gains optional `system_prompt`, `max_response_tokens`, and
  `request_timeout_seconds`; omitting them leaves behavior unchanged.
- Tool-use conversations: `AITool`, `AIToolCall`, `AITokenUsage`,
  `AITurnResult`, `send_conversation` / `asend_conversation` (one turn per
  call; the caller owns the loop and executes tools), forced `tool_choice`,
  strict tools, replayable `raw_content`, and `build_tool_result_message`.
- Async variants (`asend_prompt`, `asend_structured_output`,
  `asend_conversation`) on engines whose SDK has an async client, starting
  with `claude` (lazy `AsyncAnthropic`).
- Retry policy: `retry_policy="none"` (constructor), `COMPLETIONS_RETRY_POLICY`
  (environment), or `provider_options={"retry_policy": "none"}` (per call)
  disables Anthropic SDK retries. HTTP failures raise
  `AiProviderRequestError` carrying `status_code` for uniform 429/5xx/529
  classification.
- Observability: `set_observability_context` accepts arbitrary string `tags`
  emitted as `tag_<name>` fields on every event, including cost-topic events.
  Token usage is available on every new result object without parsing logs.
